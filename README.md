# likemike_twitter_bot
This simple twitter bot favorites the last 20 tweets on a person's timeline in a given list of people. After liking a tweet, the program sleeps for 30 seconds to circumvent Twitter's automation limitations. This was a little side project and is no way effiecient but it works for my purposes. 

If you wish to modify the code, make sure you first apply to use Twitter's API (https://developer.twitter.com/en). Once you are accepted, you are free to use their API. I used tweepy which is a python library (https://www.tweepy.org/). I think there is a javascript library called twit if you prefer.
